# CPA T2. Shared Memory

The **join*** operation means that a concurrent process is waiting for the latter to finish in order to continue.

The **fork** operation means that a new concurrent process begins.

On the **shared memory** model the tasks share a memory-address, and the programming is similar to the sequential since any data can be exchanged by all.
The main difficulties of the shared memory model are concurrent access to the memory, which can be problematic.

**Thread model**
