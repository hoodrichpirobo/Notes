# AIC 1.2. Performance Analysis (2).

There's E(fficiency) Cores and P(erformance) cores nowadays on CPUs.

A coprocessor is a secondary processor that works alongside the main CPU to handle a specific class of tasks faster or more efficiently than the CPU would on its own. The CPU orchestrates the work; the coprocessor does the heavy lifting for that niche.
