$P_{w_{dynamic}} = \frac{1}{2} \times C \times V^2 \times f$ 
$P_{w_{static}} = I_{leakage} \times V$

Power per transistor = $(\frac{1}{2} \times C \times V^2 \times f) + I_{leakage} \times V$
				 = $P_{w_{dynamic}} + P_{w_{static}}$

## Lecture Notes.

	There are many type of computers, such as: PC, embedded, and/or mobile computer, server, etc.
	what is the most important thing if you want to store something on a cloud platform, or any other computer server like a smartwatch, or to store information? availability to not let locked out of the system on a critical moment
	Feature size is the size of a transistor. If the feature size decreases, the density of the transistor increases (number of transistors)
	What they do is increment the number of cores in the transistor and increase the simplicity of it
	Usually to increase the dynamic power we increase the frequency since it's proportional to the latter.
	Transistors are now built on a 3d way
	Apart of the frequency, also the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architectures is the thing that makes the processors better.
	The processor of the cellphone is designed on a passive way such that we don't need any cooling system.
	With improved microarchitecture and parallelism, a CPU can be several times faster at the same clock; performance isnâ€™t only about frequency.
	You want to have reliability, availability, safety, integrity, and confidentiality on the design of your computer architecture.
