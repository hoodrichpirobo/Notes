# Notes

This repository is a personal experiment with the Zettelkasten note-taking method. I enjoy collecting ideas and wanted a place to test how the system helps connect and grow my notes.

## Structure

Notes are written in Markdown files. Each note is intended to be concise and focused on a single concept, making it easy to link related ideas through tags and references.

## Goals

- Capture insights from classes and readings
- Explore connections between topics using cross-links and tags
- Evaluate how well the Zettelkasten system supports long-term learning
