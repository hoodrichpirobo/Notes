Back on 1978, during the Software crisis they used to produce a huge amount of software that was never used. They didn't have a proper problem-solving ability since they spent 8% of the time on analysis and design but later on they spent a 75% of the time on maintenance. This would never happen to Petr Mitrichev. That is cost of fixing errors.

Quality factors goes into the exam. Can you describe them, which quality factor does this corresponds to?

Quality factors

* The classification of the quality factors of software takes into account three important aspects of a software product

  1. Its operational features
  2. Its capability to support updates
  3. Its adaptability to new environments

* These must be measured direct or indirectly during the whole development process

Quality factors

Operational features

* **Correctness** — Does it do what I want?
* **Reliability** — Is it reliable all the time?
* **Efficiency** — Will it run in the HW platform efficiently?
* **Integrity** — Is it safe?
* **Usability** — Is it designed to be used?

Supporting Updates

* **Maintainability** — May it be corrected?
* **Flexibility** — May it be easily changed?
* **Testability** — May it be verified?

Adaptability to New environments

* **Reusability** — Is the software reusable?
* **Portability** — May it be used in another HW or OS?
* **Interoperability** — May it interact with another system?
