Intelligence derives from the Latin verb intelligere, a combination of **intus** (between) and **legere** (to choose), that is, to **choose** (correctly) **between options**.

The history of AI is the history of a computer science branch evolving since 1940 and moving between two philosophical views: 
	**Empiricism/behaviorism:** the (sensorial) experience is the main source of knowledge and adaptation of the behavior. This is the modern approach.
	**Racionalism/cognitivism:** the (logic) reasoning is the main source of knowledge and adaptation of the mind. This is the old school approach.

The evolution of AI correlates mainly through the development of three fields, those are:
	Data
	Computer power (GPU)
	Software (Torch, PyTorch, TensorFlow)

Turing Test is a proposed answer by Alan Turing to whether a machine can think or not through a series of questions

Symbolic AI is an example of the former method of developing AI which was racionalism, the philosophy of just using a coder to instruct the machine what where the logical decisions to make on each context.

After Symbolic AI, comes machine learning which is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed, mainly through statistics and probability.

One great example of speech recognition AI is [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) , with these advancements you can make a person who only speaks Spanish talk in any language you can imagine.
